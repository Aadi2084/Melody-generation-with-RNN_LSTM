# Melody Generator Project

## Introduction
This project is a comprehensive melody generator using advanced machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, innovative model building, and training scripts. The project leverages bi-directional LSTM networks to generate musical melodies from a given dataset.

## Usage

Data Preprocessing: Use pre_process.ipynb to preprocess your dataset.
Training the Model: Run train_bi_LSTM.py to train the bi-directional LSTM model.
Generating Melodies: Use melodygenerator_1.py to generate melodies using the trained model.
